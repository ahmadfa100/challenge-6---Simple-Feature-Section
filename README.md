# challenge-6---Simple-Feature-Section
This project is a SaaS feedback page built with HTML and CSS. It features a responsive multi-card layout with icons, text, and images. The goal was to enhance design skills by creating visually appealing and organized components. I learned to use typography, color contrast, and spacing effectively for better readability and aesthetics.
